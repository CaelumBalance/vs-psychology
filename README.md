# VS Psychology – Balance Between Light and Darkness

Welcome to the portfolio site of **Svetla Slaveeva Vlahova**, psychologist and explorer of the human psyche through symbolism, duality, and the transformative power of introspection.

🔮 **"Only the strong master chaos; the weak seek order."**  
🌗 **"When the wise man points at the stars, the fool looks at his finger."**

This minimalist page was created to reflect a delicate harmony – between the rational and the intuitive, the light and the shadow.
